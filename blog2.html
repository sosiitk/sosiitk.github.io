              <h5 style="color:brown">What are the greatest problems that we face today?</h5>
              <p>Ask this question to anyone, and the answer would be along these lines: poverty, rising inequality, poor healthcare system to deal with diseases, lack of quality education, lack of clean water, rising carbon emissions, lack of decent work opportunities. These are not very different from the challenges as seen by the leaders of the world. The Millennium Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2000 or the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015 talk about the very same issues.
                The question in front of us is: Are we, who are considered the brightest minds of the country, thinking about these problems? Unfortunately, for most IIT students, the top-notch places to land a job are turning out to be companies such as Goldman Sachs, Facebook, BCG, World Quant, or Blackrock. The idea of working towards solving these problems is seen as the responsibility of the government or those working in NGOs.
                One may argue that as students of an Institute of Technology, one is not really supposed to work on such policy issues; they are rather supposed to work in cutting edge research or deployment of new technologies. However, with the development of field in the last few years, the domain of public policy also provides enough exciting opportunities for working in technology, while solving real life problems at the same time. In this blog, I'll try to explain what is public policy, what does it entail, how data and technology is becoming integral to public policy, and how are IITians contributing to the field by trying to work towards some of the above problems. </p>
              
              <h5 style="color:brown">Deciding a career!</h5>
              <p>
                Let's roll back to the time when we joined IIT. Full of dreams and expectations, many aim to make the world a better place by becoming scientists or engineers. The understanding of the scope of careers at IITs is initially limited to only these areas for most of us. The plethora of courses and activities at campus broadens this understanding by exposing us to different domains. We are exposed to the world of art through music, dance, literature, dramatics and the world of sports, which is new for many. The Humanities and Social Sciences courses expose us to the fields of Economics, Sociology, Philosophy and Psychology. It's true that the extent to which these courses are taught, at undergraduate level, do not capture the practical illustrations of public policy as such. This is where many other initiatives at IITK such as the Policy Conclave organised by the Students Opinion Society are helpful for students to understand the world of policy.
                Most of us must have seen the movie '3 Idiots'. An important message of the movie "life is not a race" seems rather obvious when we hear it. But it's way more difficult to follow it when it comes to internships and placements at IITs. Instead of carefully thinking about what type of work we wish to do, what we wish to learn, or doing some research about the companies; the only dream becomes landing a job on Day 1 or Day 2. In doing so, we fall victim to the trap of rat race, and neglect introspecting what career is best suited for us based on the exposure we have gained.
                There are three fundamental questions that come to mind while deciding a career. First, what is it that one wishes to learn or do in life. Second, what is it that one is good at. And third, what is the impact of the options one is considering. This impact can be economic, political or moral. All of these questions are essential. There's no point doing something one is good at but doesn't wish to do; similarly, perhaps not much point doing something one wants to but is not any good at. But most importantly, what misses the consideration for most of us is the third question. The same happened with me.
              </p>

              <h5 style="color:brown">My journey</h5>
              <p>
                To be fair, the question of impact usually starts hitting one only after they take up a job, only to later find it not impactful (or having a negative impact). Just like others, I also went with the flow of rat race in trying to bag an early placement, and took a job at a consulting firm. But within a few months, I started wondering about the impact of this job, and realised that the bottom line of my job description is to make my clients richer. Those in consulting will rephrase this with ton of business jargon to make it seem like that's not what's happening. But that's what business consulting is essentially about, to maximise revenue/growth/profit for your clients. Moreover, you rarely get to select your clients, and most clients are anyway large MNCs who usually only hire consultants to either look good or get the cheap Indian labour. In most cases, there is little impact on the business, and absolutely no tangible impact to the society, despite what one is made to believe. Some would argue that it's still worth it because of the skills they are learning. Granted, but one can learn the same skills elsewhere too, and be a part of solving problems which matter. That became my reason to leave the corporate job and join Samagra, a government consulting organisation.
                At Samagra, I worked with the education department of the government of Himachal Pradesh. My project aimed at improving the quality of education in Himachal Pradesh. Our objective was to get the state amongst the top three states in the country in educational outcomes. To achieve this objective, many actionables were identified over a short period of time, ranging from setting up a monitoring and evaluation system for schools, digitising and analysing assessments data, improving communication from the departments to schools, and encouraging teachers through awards and public participation. A dashboard created by our project to collect, digitise and analyse assessment data of students (called the Samarth Assessment Dashboard) recently received the ‘Skoch Award’ at the national-level for digitisation of assessments, and providing data for decision making.  The state’s education department was also approached by Chandigarh’s education department to study the dashboard.
                Currently, I work at PRS Legislative Research. At PRS, we work with MPs from Parliament across political parties and MLAs from various states, to provide them with the necessary data, research and analysis to improve the process of legislative policy making. Further, we try to increase public engagement in the legislative process and on issues of national importance by providing citizens with information on policy issues and legislative analysis. For citizens to be able to make better decisions at the time of elections, we track the parliamentary performance of individual MPs (attendance, participation in debates) through our MP Track initiative.
              </p>

              <h5 style="color:brown">What does Public Policy entail</h5>
              <p>
                Firstly, I want to clarify that Public Policy is not about nation building per se. It is not the same as working for the country by joining the army or joining the civil services. It is also not the same as Mohan Bhargava of Swadesh where you will be working in a village trying to empower the villagers.
                Public policy, just like every other domain of work, is a professional career field aimed at strengthening the making and implementation of a policy. Policy, in simple terms, is generally understood as a plan of action agreed to by a group of people with the power to carry it out and enforce it (Dodd and Boyd), not necessarily by the government. Consider a question: what should be the Pupil-Teacher Ratio for optimal learning levels in schools? Policy making is all about making decisions such as this one. The second step is implementation of the policy. For any policy to be effective, there also needs to be a feedback mechanism from the beneficiaries of the policy. This feedback should also, ideally, go back in the policy making step for any future decision making.
                There are many organisations working in different areas of the field. For instance, organisations like PRS, Centre for Policy Research (CPR), J-PAL and Harvard's Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) aim to strengthen the part of policy making through providing credible research. Development consulting organisations like IdInsight, Samagra Governance and Sattva Consulting aim to strengthen policy implementation, by working with the government or other organisations involved in the process. Companies such as SocialCops and Outline India are focused on leveraging data and technology in the social sector to develop products which can be helpful for other smaller organisations. IdInsight also does great work in measurement and evaluation of several government projects, which is crucial for the feedback loop.
                Some organisations work in specific areas for providing extensive support in policy implementation. For instance, Pratham Education Foundation and Clinton Health Access Initiative are primarily focused on education and healthcare, respectively. These organisations often work directly with the state governments, but also have their own education/health related projects. The Nudge Foundation is an organisation specifically focused towards poverty alleviation through social innovation and rural development.
                Secondly, we should know that although the field is still evolving, one can fine numeral examples of organisations using the same cutting edge technology or research that corporates use. A company called Blue Sky Analytics is trying to democratise environmental data using Satellite data and AI, for better environmental intelligence and decision making. IdInsight is working on a project where Machine Learning is being used to predict where the maximum number of out of school children are likely to be, in order to enrol them back in schools.
                Finally, one last thing to know about public policy is that the lifestyle isn't opposite of corporate jobs, either. Many organisations in the sector pay quite well, almost equivalent to many corporate jobs. This is largely due to the initiatives of a few large philanthropic agencies such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which have recently been investing heavily on development in India.
                Further, just like every other field, rest assured that there is no dearth of IITians in public policy. My current company (PRS) as well as the previous company I worked for (Samagra Governance) are both founded by IITians. Many of my batchmates are working in this field, as consultants, data scientists, product managers and researchers. So one can build a profile for any role, at the same time working towards solving interesting problems related to development.
              </p>

              <h5 style="color:brown">It's not an all cosy story.</h5>
              <p>
                And of course, there's a flip-side to everything. Firstly, although the compensation is closing in with corporate jobs, it still does remain below theirs, except for a few organisations which pay quite well. Secondly, since the sector is relatively new, there is sometimes a lack of structure within the organisations, and many new organisations operate like start-ups. Although to be fair, that's becoming the case in the corporate sector as well.
                But most importantly, it is the notion of creating tangible, scalable and rapid impact which disappoints many who come to this sector. When you're working on something like primary education with a state government, rest assured that you will get to solve really interesting problems, but to be able to see results will take its time. Sometimes you may put in years of effort and may still not see the impact you were looking for. This is because what qualifies as impact is sometimes difficult to define or measure (for some impact metrics are qualitative). Further, the success of some interventions are often dependent on multiple other factors such as the functioning of the other government officials. Therefore, it is easy to lose patience or motivation to continue working.
                Yet, for those who wish to solve these problems, such roadblocks or hindrances should not be a demotivation. For change may take time, but to be able to get the process of change started is also a step in the right direction. You may not be able to transform something entirely, but given the large segment of population who stands to benefit from any positive changes in public policy, your efforts could still be very fruitful in transforming the lives of many.
