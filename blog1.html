            <a class="category mb-5" href="#">Public Policy</a> <a class="category mb-5" href="#">Social Development</a> 
           
            <div class="post-content-body">
              <p style="color:#3399FF">“Best options just whisper to you, they never roar! Now it's your responsibility to acknowledge it and transform into reality”</p>
            <p>When Students' Opinion Society approached me to write my story on why I chose Public Policy & Social Development as a career choice over high paying, luxurious Corporate Jobs, it honestly thrilled me, because to me this was one of the opportunities where I could reason out what all went behind finalizing this and more importantly to publicize this less travelled by pretty orthodox career option to the campus audience.</p>
            <p>Now as I think of it, it was not any particular incident, phase or time which motivated me towards the field, rather it was a journey with various incidents & encounters which slowly boosted my interest towards it and made me commit to one of the most exciting domains to work in.</p>
            <h5 style="color:brown">The Beginning</h5>
            <p>It all started sometime in the mid of third year when I was exposed for the first time to this domain, a senior of mine informed me about a couple of firms working in the domain and the type of work which they do. To a pretty capitalist & money-oriented ideology of mine, the idea didn’t suit well, it took me less than a second to discard it then and go ahead with my plans for the Presidential Elections. Fast forward to February 2019, I got elected as the President of Students’ Gymkhana, multiple allegations got filed against the election and the election got called off.</p>
            <h5 style="color:brown">The Spark</h5>
            <p>Now with no work to do and a lot of time in hand, coupled with few of my friends continuously motivating me to consider preparing for UPSC to make my mark in Civil Services, I decided to at least improve my understanding about the domain and various opportunities in it. To start with, I felt what’s better than understanding the life journey of a Civil Servant and type of projects and roles they work on. Quickly purchased the book “Advice & Dissent”, the autobiography of Retired IAS, Former Governor of RBI Dr Y.V. Reddy. His life story truly felt like a joyful roller coaster ride with many ups and downs & power to create a positive impact in the lives of fellow citizens. Well yes, it is important to note that the ups and downs in the story were completely built by the political arena, and as he calls them, those were something which were totally out of his hands. The story as a whole surely gave the initial ignite to know more about the domain but it also made me uncertain about the political influence which it brings with itself.</p>

            </div>
            <h5 style="color:brown">Final Year and After</h5>
            <p>Then came the final year, the most important to say, which completely changed my thinking and made me accept how counter-intuitive the world is. Among the varios learnings, the most important one was the encounter with the real India, India which is far different from the “Illusion” within which most of us live. The 1000-2000 people around whom we spend most of our lives are not the random sample, they are not even the representation of India, they are the very part of “Elite” society.</p>
            <h5 style="color:brown">The Inspiration</h5>
            <p>The biggest share in transforming my thoughts surely goes to Prof. Rahul Varman, I took a couple of courses under him and one thing which he classically presented was what goes behind the highly lucrative figures which we enjoy! What goes behind the 50% profit margin of Apple products, how divided the society is where the top 5% aims for the US and the bottom 40% wishes for Sub-Saharan! The courses were surely an eye-opener which made me encounter the highly distributed society and the dark part of it, it certainly motivated me to become more serious about the domain and to understand my role as an individual to at least make an effort in improving the scenario. It was then that I finalized to have a trip across Kanpur, to just observe the workers on the street, those sleeping beside Railway Station, the schools in Nankari (The very Institute of National Importance which is celebrating the 60th Year and was envisioned to improve the educational stature of the country, the schools just on its periphery were in the worst conditions). The encounters were so mind-boggling that they were sufficient for me to finalize the path I wanted to walk on.</p>
            <h5 style="color:brown">Career Steps: Achievements</h5>
            <p>With the willingness to have a career in the Development Sector I started with finding small
              opportunities in the domain to get experience before applying for any role. The first one was Yukti,
              the Case Study Competition jointly organized by Indian School of Business & Clinton Health Access
              Initiatives, over there we were supposed to frame out the strategies to combat a hypothetical
              disease in a regulated system. To come up with a solution, I with my team-mate went through
              various healthcare models being followed across the world and the information document of
              National Health Mission. The process of critically analysing how policies are framed & implemented
              in a domain like healthcare across the world was, honestly, very interesting to work out. We were
              the only UG team which made it to the finals and eventually we finished as the second runner up.
              The discussion with the delegates from CHAI after the event was quite an enriching one as it made
              me aware about the firms creating phenomenal real-life impact at scale even without directly being
              the part of the governmental system rather by co-working with them. This was exactly what I was
              looking for! The overall experience and great result gave the required boost.</p>
              <div class="row mb-5">
                <div class="col-md-12 mb-4">
                  <img src="images/blog1_1.jpg" alt="Image placeholder" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
              </div>
              <h5 style="color:brown">Steps before the major step</h5>
            <p>To get a deeper understanding and to finally re-evaluate the decision, I invited Mr Anil Swarup, the
              Ex-Education Secretary, GoI to the campus for a talk. He was kind enough to accept my invitation
              and visit the campus. The robust discussion which lasted for more than 5 hours with him regarding
              his life journey, his perspective on role of social development firms, the need of quality workforce in
              this segment to create a positive impact at scale and whatnot, was so motivating and fulfilling that it
              finally made me confident about my decision. All the insecurities going on and on in my head about
              the fieldwork, low pay, high demanding work, days in rural India etc were gone and the final decision
              was made.</p>
            <p>I also attended the Good Governance Yatra which is a 9 days immersive travel program organized
              annually by Vision India Foundation, where you travel across 4 states and experience more than 25
              projects around governance, social enterprise, public administration & technology adoption. The
              Yatra helped me connect with 70+ like-minded people willing to have a stint in this domain & with
              Bureaucratic Leaders, Project Directors, Politicians & Activists to better understand the vision &
              problems being faced at the various hierarchies of the Indian Democracy.</p>
              <h5 style="color:brown">Exploration and Research</h5>
              <p>Being blur with my vision of creating an impact in the lives of people at scale, I started my research
              to explore the opportunities in the mentioned sector. I started by listing down all the opportunities
              in the sector (~150 opportunities) and then segmenting them based on their mission and the ways
              they follow to achieve it, I broadly divided the opportunities into 4 segments i.e. Policy Research,
              Corporate & Foundation Consulting, Political Campaign Management & Governance Consulting.
              After this, I attempted to connect with the alums working in the domain to better understand the
              role of each segment in the larger picture, what changes they are attempting to bring, the type of
              projects they work on and how a regular life in that segment looks like.</p>
            <h5 style="color:brown">The Final Decision</h5>
            <p>After an elaborate comparison between the firms based on their Impactibility and Scalability in
              terms of their reach and the lever of change with which they associate, and comparing their
              expectations with my competencies, I finalized to go ahead with Governance Consulting as an ideal
              domain to work in. Even at such a young age, the domain provides with a remarkable opportunity to
              directly co-work with the Political & Bureaucratic leadership of the State and Centre, it allows to
              improve the livelihood of the citizens by systematically transforming the various domains, be it
              improving the learning outcome of the students, improving the revenue for farmers, aiding the
              government offices build on their capacity, improving the system from the technological point of
              view to reduce corruption or anything under the sky! The domain gives an amazing opportunity to
              learn and grow!</p>
            <h5 style="color:brown">Rounding Off</h5>
            <p>Finally, now I have a couple of offers from Corporate Houses, call from IIM Kolkata and a placement
              offer from Samagra | Transforming Governance. Though among the given options, the one which is
              least financially satisfactory is Samagra | Transforming Governance but the opportunities it provides
              to grow, learn and create an impact in a larger picture is just incomparable. The firm provides with
              amazing opportunities to co-work with Political & Bureaucratic Leadership to transform the lives at the ground rather than just visualizing the highly lucrative numbers on the screen. I am eagerly waiting for my very first stint in this domain to start, and yes, I am finally sure of the answer to the
              question, “What do I want? Whether to improve the lives of 65 Lakh+ farmers of Orissa, 1 Crore+ elementary students of UP…… or to help the corporates earn 1 more crore of profit?”</p>
